# Getting Started with Git & GitHub

This is my first time connecting a local git repository to GitHub.

### all steps needed to make a push to a repository

1. make sure to add and commit using  ```git add file``` and  ```git commit -m message``` 
2. add the remote connection to the repository using ```git remote add origin git@github.com:mukayilaalao/git-and-github.git```
3. Update the file to the remote repository using ```git push origin master/main```
4. refresh github site to notice the change.
